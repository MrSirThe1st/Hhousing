## Entry Rules

- Append only meaningful changes.
- Group related changes into one entry.
- Use concise, factual descriptions.
- Include DB, API, structure, and important logic decisions.
- Record deferred testing gaps when relevant.

## Template

## 2026-03-28
- Change type: Other
- Description: Imported project blueprint (charter, architecture map, dependency boundaries, quality gates, ADR template, AI agent system docs). Created `project-context.md` with product purpose, user types, workflows, glossary, non-goals, and fixed tech decisions. Added `docs/decisions/ADR-001-adopt-project-blueprint.md`.
- Impact: Establishes operating rules, monorepo structure conventions, error contracts, approval gates, and dependency boundary enforcement for all future work.
- Tests: N/A

## 2026-03-28
- Change type: Infra
- Description: Added root workspace scripts (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`) in `package.json` and wired CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run setup, lint, typecheck, test, and build gates on PRs and pushes to `main`/`develop`.
- Impact: Establishes baseline local quality commands and required CI gates aligned with blueprint quality policy.
- Tests: Deferred (no app/package test targets exist yet in this docs-only phase).
